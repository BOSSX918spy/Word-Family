# Word Family Drag-and-Drop Practice

A simple, mobile-friendly web activity for 6th-grade students to practice three-letter word families (_AT, ET, IT, OT, UT, AN, OG, IP_) by dragging the missing initial letter into the blank. Each word is accompanied by an English and Punjabi hint. Words and letters are shuffled on each load for a fresh experience.
